## Learning to quickly set up a RESTful API with Rails

What was practiced:

* Creating our Models, Views and Controllers

* Seeding the database with dummy data using the Faker gem

* Setting up the API controllers in a versioned folder structure for ease of future iterations

* Ensure all CRUD operations are covered by their route + controller functions for full RESTful functionalities

* Practice fixing bugs with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests using Postman
