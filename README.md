## Learning to build a full stack app with React and Rails

What was practiced:

* Rails --api 

* Scaffolding our Models, Controllers and Routes

* Instead of Seeding the database, using the Rails console to instantiate and save new Active Record objects

* Versioning the API using namespace for prefixing the url path

* create-react-app

* Using Material UI 

* Functional components
